# Shortest Path Algorithm Comparison

A comparative analysis of three different approaches to solving the shortest path problem on a 2D grid with obstacles:
- **D-Wave Quantum CQM** (Constrained Quadratic Model)
- **PuLP** (Linear Programming with CBC/Gurobi solver)
- **NetworkX** (Dijkstra's Algorithm)

## ðŸŽ¯ Features

- Support for diagonal movements with configurable weights
- Random obstacle generation
- Visual comparison of paths from different algorithms
- Side-by-side performance metrics
- Easy-to-use modular code structure
